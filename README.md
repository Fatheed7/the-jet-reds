# The Jet Reds website

This website was created as a first portfolio project for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development. The Jet Reds are a real band but, with their permission, I have created this website as I have an interest in and actively follow the band.

  ## Wireframes

  The wireframes for this site were created using Balasmiq, with each section and subsection noted. I endeavoured to create a single page website and, as such, wireframes are available for desktop view, tablet view and mobile view.

  The first section below shows all views together, with the second second making individual views available.
